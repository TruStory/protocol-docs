TRU is an *Inflationary* token.

When a user performs a core action on TruStory, such as Writing an Argument or Agreeing with an Argument, she is required to stake some amount of TRU for some period of time. After the period expires, she is **refunded** the stake and **rewarded an interest payment** on that stake. This interest payment (i.e. "reward") is generated by inflating TRU.

## Rewards

The interest payment earned (i.e. "rewards") is based on the stake **amount** and **period**. Currently, users stake a default amount and for a default period[1] as per below:

**Write an Argument**
- Stake required: 10 TRU
- Period: 7 days
- Interest earned: 0.2 TRU


**Agree an Argument**
- Stake required: 30 TRU
- Period: 7 days
- Interest earned: 0.6 TRU[2]

Users can also earn rewards by removing low-quality arguments. This is done by marking arguments as **Not Helpful**. Only users with 10+ Earned TruStake can mark arguments as Not Helpful.

If an Argument receives 5 or more Not Helpful votes, the argument writer and any users who Agreed with that argument have their TruStake slashed. Users who marked the Argument as Not Helpful earn a portion of this slashed TruStake.

**Mark Argument as Not Helpful**
 - Stake required: None
 - Period: None
 - Reward earned: 25% of slashed stakes, split among all Not Helpful voters 
 
[1] In the future, we may allow users to pick stake amounts and period.  
[2] Split equally between Argument creator and Agree giver.

## Min balance required

All users are required to have min balance of 50 TRU to stake. 

## Staking limits
Users have limits on how much they can have staked on the platform at once (i.e. Pending stake balanace). Users start off with a limit of 500 pending TRU.

As users earn more TRU on the platform, their staking limits increase, as per below:

- 10 total Earned TRU: 1000 pending TRU limit
- 20 total Earned TRU: 1500 pending TRU limit
- 30 total Earned TRU: 2000 pending TRU limit
- 40 total Earned TRU: 2500 pending TRU limit
- 50 total Earned TRU: 3000 pending TRU limit

... And so on.
