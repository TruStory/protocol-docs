TruStake is an *Inflationary* token.

When a user performs a core action on TruStory, such as Writing an Argument or Agreeing with an Argument, she is required to stake some amount of TruStake for some period of time. After the period expires, she is *refunded* the stake and *rewarded an interest payment* on that stake. This interest payment (i.e. "reward") is generated by inflating TruStake.

The interest payment earned is based on the stake **amount** and **period**. Currently, users stake a default amount and for a default period, as per below:

**Write an Argument**
- Stake required: 50 TruStake
- Period: 7 days
- Interest earned: 1 TruStake


**Agree an Argument**
- Stake required: 10 TruStake
- Period: 7 days
- Interest earned: 100 uTruStake *(split equally between Argument creator and Agree giver)*

_NOTE: In the future, we may allow users to pick stake amounts and period._

Users can also earn rewards by removing low-quality arguments. This is done by marking arguments as Not Helpful. Only users with 50+ Earned TruStake can mark arguments as Not Helpful.

If an Argument receives 5 or more Not Helpful votes, users who marked the Argument as Not Helpful earn rewards.

**Mark Argument as Not Helpful**
 - Stake required: None
 - Period: None
 - Reward earned: 25% of all stakes on argument, split among all Not Helpful voters
